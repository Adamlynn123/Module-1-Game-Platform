# Overview

In this game, the goal is to grab all the coins without touching the enemy worms. The worms will be moving back and forth on the platforms and you are trying to advance your way to the top without getting hit by them or you will lose the game. The worms get faster as you go up and there are more difficult areas you will have to reach. Once all the coins are collected, the game will end and you will have won.

The purpose of this game is to learn how to code a platformer game and further my knowledge of coding with Python.
